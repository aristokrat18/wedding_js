Used to be served by an express server on Heroku (back when the site had RSVP functionality), but now it is just a static site served by Netlify.

## Original README

Migrated my wedding website from Django to Node.js. Also did a full re-design and added online RSVP functionality. Check it out at [ristomegan.com](https://ristomegan.com).
